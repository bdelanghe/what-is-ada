# 🐕‍🦺 What is Ada?? 🐕‍🦺

## 🧐 About
Welcome to "What is Ada??", a fun community project that aims to determine Ada's breed once and for all! Participants can make their best guess about Ada's breed using the provided images, and the results are then scored via a specially designed algorithm.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Airtable Integration**: Easy to access and user-friendly interface with Airtable.
- **Scoring Algorithm**: A custom algorithm processes the guesses and assigns scores based on how close they are to Ada's actual breed.
- **Community Engagement**: A great way to engage with friends, family, and the larger community in a fun and lighthearted manner.

## 🎮 How to Participate
To participate in the "What is Ada??" project, follow these steps:

1. Visit the project's [Airtable link](https://airtable.com/shrYwSRDUepE4uOKi).
2. Look at the images provided and make your best guess about Ada's breed.
3. Submit your guess and see how close you were!

## 🧮 Scoring Algorithm

The scoring algorithm works by comparing the participants' guesses to Ada's actual breed. The difference (or delta) between a participant's guess and Ada's actual breed determines the score. The closer the guess to the actual breed, the higher the score. As more people participate, we get to see a clearer distribution of guesses and scores.

Please note that this scoring is just for fun and should not be used as a definitive source for breed identification.
